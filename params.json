{"name":"Observer","tagline":"","body":"### Observer.js - a lightweight pub/sub.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nI authored observer in order to have a lightweight pub/sub library to use while developing decoupled apps. This functionality is available through multiple libraries and frameworks, but I wanted to be able to have a library agnostic one. \r\n\r\n### Maintenance\r\nAny issues please contact Jim English (@jimenglish81) or submit a pull request.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
